      "content": "From the viewpoint of many Republicans, I agree with you. The fact that school shootings continue to happen is deeply troubling, and it does show that something needs to be done to protect our kids and our communities.\n\nWhile gun rights are important, there are actually Republicans who have supported common-sense gun control measures. For example, after the tragic Parkland shooting in 2018, Florida\u2019s Republican Governor Rick Scott signed a bill that raised the minimum age to buy a rifle from 18 to 21 and created a waiting period for gun purchases (Source: [NPR \u2013 Florida Gov. Scott Signs Gun Bill](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/09/592265522/florida-gov-scott-signs-gun-bill-after-parkland-shooting)). This law had support from several other Florida Republicans as well.\n\nMany Republicans, like Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, have supported background check legislation, showing that there is room for agreement on measures that don\u2019t infringe on responsible citizens\u2019 rights but help keep dangerous weapons out of the wrong hands (Source: [Toomey\u2019s website \u2013 Background Checks](https://www.toomey.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/toomey-manchin-introduce-background-check-bill-to-keep-guns-out-of-the-wrong-hands)).\n\nWhat kinds of specific gun control measures do you think would help? Do you think banning certain types of weapons or focusing on background checks would be more effective? I\u2019d like to hear your thoughts."
