Initial LLM response: I agree that everyone deserves affordable healthcare and more support. Many Democrats believe that access to healthcare shouldn’t depend on your income or job. We do think the current system has major flaws—but some would argue that issues like obesity are complex and not just about healthcare access. For example, things like healthy food options, education, and community support also play big roles. 

What do you think we should do to fix the healthcare system? Would you support government programs to make it easier for people to get care?

VM20815:61 Initial LLM response: Thanks for sharing your thoughts! I agree with you that everyone deserves affordable healthcare and social support. That’s a core belief for many Democrats—we advocate for expanding access so that no one is left behind because they can’t afford care.

However, some Republicans often argue that government involvement could make things inefficient or expensive. Democrats disagree because we see examples, like Medicare and Medicaid, where public programs have helped millions. Also, many of us believe that obesity isn’t just an individual issue—factors like food deserts, low wages, and lack of access to preventive care make it a bigger social problem.

What changes do you think would help fix the system?
