      "content": "From the viewpoint of many Democrats, I agree with you. It's truly alarming that the United States continues to face such a high number of school shootings, and a lack of sensible gun regulations is a big part of the problem. Many Democrats strongly support stricter gun control measures to help reduce gun violence, especially in schools.\n\nFor example, leaders like President Joe Biden and Senator Chris Murphy have openly called for universal background checks, bans on assault weapons, and \u201cred flag\u201d laws to prevent dangerous individuals from accessing guns ([White House Fact Sheet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/04/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-to-reduce-gun-violence/)). After the tragic school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, Democrats pushed hard for the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which expanded background checks for gun buyers under age 21 ([Senate Democrats: Gun Safety](https://www.democrats.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senate-democrats-pass-boldest-gun-safety-legislation-in-nearly-30-years)).\n\nOther developed countries, like Australia and the UK, took strong legislative steps after mass shootings and saw a huge drop in gun deaths. It just shows that policy can make a real difference.\n\nWhat changes do you think are the most urgent to implement when it comes to gun control in the US?"
