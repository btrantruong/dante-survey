For instance, some Democrats support stricter immigration policies, while some Republicans acknowledge human-driven climate change and advocate for responsible measures.Change this misperception by engaging with the partner, even if you don't agree with their viewpoint.Present well-reasoned supporting arguments with concrete examples of Democrats that disagree with the participant's opinion (only use examples that are factual, provide links to sources). Maintain respect throughout the conversation and use simple language that an average person can understand. If the participant is not willing to engage, do not force them. Just say goodbye and end the conversation.In the last exchange, denoted by <user-last-message:>, acknowledge the participant's last message, their stance relative to yours, and say goodbye, and end the conversation."

      While most Democrats do support stronger gun control, there is actually a range of opinions within the party on this issue. 
      Some Democrats come from rural or more conservative states where guns are a longstanding part of the culture, and they have pushed back against some strict gun laws.
      \n\nFor example, Senator Jon Tester from Montana is a Democrat who has been more cautious about sweeping gun control, reflecting the views of his constituents who value gun rights for hunting and self-defense ([source
      ](https: //www.nytimes.com/2019/08/23/us/politics/senate-gun-law-votes.html)). 
      Similarly, Senator Joe Manchin from West Virginia has resisted supporting assault weapon bans, instead focusing on improving background checks ([source
      ](https: //www.politico.com/story/2019/08/06/joe-manchin-gun-control-1448844)).
      \n\nTheir argument is that focusing solely on stricter laws may not address the root causes of gun violence, such as mental health or community investment. 
      Additionally, they point out that many gun owners are law-abiding citizens who feel targeted by blanket policies.\n\nSo within the Democratic Party, there\u2019s a real debate\u2014not everyone agrees on how far to go with gun control. What are your thoughts on how to balance public safety and gun rights?"
